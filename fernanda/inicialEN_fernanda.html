            <p>
                For years, the social network Instagram was appreciated for sharing personal photos and videos, without
                any
                sort of commercial connection, as it has today. With its emergence in 2010, this platform, although
                already
                well known in Brazil and in other countries, did not provide attention and care to users already
                marginalized in society, as in the case of the deaf, blind, people with low vision and reduced mobility.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2011, there was the first form of inclusion with the possibility of users being able to add
                alternative
                text to the caption of the photos, but it was never very encouraged or publicized.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the years passed and there was a greater interest in adding more diverse tools, in order to
                have
                more and more fair accessibility to all, since the purpose of the social network has also changed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The so-called content creators began to gain more and more space on the internet. Consequently, social
                media
                has become a place for production and source of revenue for many people and, with Instagram, this was no
                different. Thus, despite accessibility, nowadays, has become, for the most part, a more capitalistic
                concern
                than in fact guaranteeing access to information, it was precisely with the aim of having more consumers
                that
                the platform adapted itself and, today, it guarantees a greater space for accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a way, these contents are seen more today than they were in the year when the social network was
                created.
                However, there are still many obstacles to be mitigated and, subsequently, excluded in all forms of
                content
                production within the platform, in the case of Photos, Videos, Stories and Reels.
            </p>
            <div class="titulo">
                <h3 id="layout">Is the platform layout accessible?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Instagram promotes some accessibility tools to make the user experience more comfortable, such as
                examples
                of dark mode and automatic and personalized alt text, in addition to periodically updating to improve
                the
                experience of users who need the screen reader.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instagram also promotes guides to activate these types of tools, which teach in detail how to activate
                dark
                mode on iOS and Android devices, but not yet in the browser version, as its use is not allowed. You can
                also
                find a guide to using screen readers on different devices - VoiceOver on iOS and Apple computers;
                TalkBack
                in the Android version; o Job Access With Speech (JAWS) for Internet Explorer on Windows OS browsers and
                NVDA for Firefox. Even being one of the biggest social networks in the world, Instagram still has a very
                long way to go to become an example of an accessible app or website. The Access Monitor website was used
                to
                perform accessibility tests on the homepage in the browser version, and the homepage of the Instagram
                website obtained a score of 7.4 on the Access Monitor website. One of the hits was that all the images
                on
                the page had the necessary alternative text equivalent, and some of the errors were the impossibility of
                the
                first hyperlink on the page to jump directly to the main content area and 24 color combinations whose
                contrast ratio is lower than minimum contrast allowed by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                (WCAG).
                During tests carried out in the application's options menu, it was not possible to find any option to
                increase the size of the font used, and even though it is possible to increase the font size through the
                smartphone's settings or through the browser, the font size of some elements is fixed , as is the
                example of
                the name of users who post stories. Instagram promotes the use of CC captions in Stories and Reels
                through
                the “stickers” option, but during tests it was not possible to find the option.
            </p>
            <p>
                An accessible Instagram experience doesn't just depend on the app or the web version, but also on
                content
                creators and users in general, but they don't have control over the design and layout part on instagram.
                Changes are being made, and to exemplify, it is possible to observe the improvement in the focus of
                elements
                when using a screen reader, now it only takes 2 taps on the screen instead of 30 to navigate a post.
            </p>
            <div class="titulo">
                <h3 id="fotos">Accessibility in photos</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                When it comes to image accessibility, some features have been developed since the early years of the
                emergence of the social network. With the use of technologies from the most basic to the most advanced,
                these are the accessible ways, so far, found for content to reach everyone:
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternative text: This is basically a descriptive caption for a post. That is, with this feature it is
                possible for mobile screen readers (the most common being VoiceOver [iOS] and TalkBack [Android]) to
                read
                aloud to a blind or low vision person. Alternative text is not visible, only the screen reader can
                identify
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To write or edit an image, just go to the desired post > three dots symbol in the top corner > tap
                “Edit” >
                tap “Edit alt text” > enter the description of the image and finish. The description will be read when
                screen reader is enabled on the user's device.
            </p>
            <p>
                #pratodosverem: This is a feature that was not created by Instagram, but it can be useful for everyone.
                To
                use it, just put it together with the caption you want “#pratodosverem” and then immediately describe
                what
                is in the post.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to what is provided by Instagram, it is extremely important to advise users on using high
                contrast in photos. It should be remembered when the image is formed by written text, since many people
                with
                low vision do not use the screen reader, but also cannot access any content easily. It is also important
                to
                remind them to use simpler, straighter fonts, avoiding those that are heavily contoured or difficult to
                understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is worth remembering that the language must also be accessible, so the text must be as clear,
                objective
                and detailed as possible and highlight the main points of the image in order to facilitate access to the
                content.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reach more people, the image description should be done from left to right and top to bottom. In
                addition, that it is also an impartial description and that it does not qualify the image in a moral way
                (describing something as beautiful/ugly and etc.).
            </p>
            <div class="titulo">
                <h3 id="videos">Accessibility on videos</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                Videos are already part of our daily lives precisely because of the growing interest of social networks
                in
                having them on their platforms as one of the main forms of language. Instagram, following the success of
                competing companies like TikTok and, previously, YouTube, has brought with it a huge spread of this
                format
                since the last few months. Currently, it is unlikely, for example, that an Instagram user will use it
                and
                not come across a “videomeme” or even a Reels. However, when it comes to accessibility, there are still
                some
                points to be improved on this platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                automatically generated subtitles: the platform has automatic subtitle generation, which can be
                activated by
                clicking on "Advanced Settings", then on "Accessibility" and on the option "Display subtitles". However,
                there are two issues related to generating subtitles for deaf people
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, it is worth mentioning that disability is a condition to which everyone is subject, that is,
                at
                some point in life, anyone may need adaptations to continue enjoying Instagram. Therefore, it is
                necessary
                for the subtitles to be accurate and for the system to be able to identify the language spoken, to
                accurately recognize which word is being said and to make, if necessary, an effective change in the
                language
                in case of multilingual videos.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second problem with subtitles is that they do not cater to those who did not have the opportunity to
                be
                literate before they lost their hearing. Since the written system is difficult to teach even to those
                with
                hearing, the best option would be for sign language to be available on the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Description of gestures and expressions: Something that can make all the difference in the videos is the
                description of the gestures and expressions of the participants. Body language is of total relevance to
                the
                understanding of several videos on Instagram, since it is quite common for there to be irony in the
                videos
                and the understanding of much of what happens is almost always visual.
            </p>

            <video controls poster="img/demo.png">
                <source src="img/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                <object>
                    <embed src="img/video.mp4" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="false"
                        allowscriptaccess="always">
                </object>
            </video>
            <p>
                In the video above, the humor completely depends on the description of what is happening in the image (a
                woman is distracted and carefree eating, but is disconcerted when she realizes she is being filmed and
                tries
                to hide her embarrassment by waving and smiling at the camera.) Not understanding the language visually,
                the
                humor of the video would be completely compromised.
            </p>
            <p>
                Name the ones who speak: naming the ones who speak the names in the video is also essential for the
                understanding of people with blindness or low vision. When there are 2 or more people in the video, it
                is
                necessary to distinguish who is speaking, since the listener will not always be able to understand who
                said
                and what without help, especially when you have a video with several people of the same gender
            </p>
            <p>
                It is one of the most consumed formats in the world in recent times and that is adaptable to be better
                accessible. However, the platform seeks to bring improvements that do not prioritize a greater reach of
                the
                audience that has a limitation to consume content that does not bring them facilities
            </p>
            <div class="titulo">
                <h3 id="stories">Accessibility on Stories</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
                This content format allows you to share both photos and videos that are available for 24 hours, just
                like
                the pioneer of the Snapchat format. It also includes the addition of icons to make the content more
                interactive, as well as free texts and illustrations. It is worth mentioning the progress that the
                platform
                has brought in issues of accessibility in Stories, such as:
            </p>
            <p>
                Caption for each icon: When adding a song or a countdown, for example, the icons are accompanied by
                captions
                for better identification. In this case, it is possible that they are recognized by a verbal and
                non-verbal
                language, which includes illiterate people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Changing the side of the menu: The menu for creating different layouts and effects when posting photos
                and
                videos, like the Boomerang option, can be placed either on the right or on the left. This makes it
                possible
                to help the person choose which side is best for everyday functions to be used.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accessibility in the songs: It is possible to add a song to this type of temporary publication and that
                can
                be placed in different formats, either showing only the name of the song and the author, or with the
                lyrics
                of the song explicit. In the latter case, the lyrics follow the tempo of the song and no information is
                passed in a delayed way. In addition, both options mentioned can have their colors and sizes changed so
                that
                the user can see how they can generate a better contrast for reading and identification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Textual content: This type of tool is used for aesthetics, identification of visual elements, and
                currently,
                some content creators use it as a form of handwritten caption (CC). In addition, it is possible to
                access
                content in different languages, as the automatic translation option associated with Google Translate
                reads
                this subtitle and translates it literally.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hands-free” recording: In the side corner of the menu it is possible for a video to be recorded without
                the
                constant use of fingers during recording. Just click once and the recording starts, with a maximum
                duration
                of 1 min and the fingers are needed again to stop it, if this video lasts for less than 60 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite many tools that help the process of making the platform more accessible, it is not necessary to
                find, for example, subtitles for all songs, nor is there the option to activate automatic subtitles, as
                found in videos shared in the feed. Also, there is no instruction for these content creators on how to
                use
                color so that people with color blindness can have access to the same information, without there being a
                big
                difference from the original intention.
            </p>
            <p>
                Undoubtedly, Instagram is one of the most far-reaching platforms here in Brazil. However, some of the
                more
                advanced tools that could facilitate many accessibility processes are still available for a limited list
                of
                countries, and Brazil is not one of them. Extensions for automatic subtitles for Reels and Stories are
                already a reality in other parts of the world, but this audio-to-text conversion is lacking for
                Brazilian
                users.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is certainly necessary that plug-ins are created in order to guarantee a greater reach of content and
                that they are available for all platforms (Mac, iOS, Android, Windows), but also in all regions where it
                is
                possible to access the application. In addition, better awareness of content creators is made so that
                the
                importance of accessible content reaches their understanding in order to guarantee information to all.
